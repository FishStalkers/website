I am honor to be invited to speak with Georgia Tech's Bioinformatics Organization on their Graduate school panel. It's inspiring to see so many students interested in entering this emerging field early in their career. We had great conversations about courses and experiences that will help students figure out if they want to pursue bioinformatics for graduate education. Missed the panel? Feel free to reach out and continue the discussion with me here.
