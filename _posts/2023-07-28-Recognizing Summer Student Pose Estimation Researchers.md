  ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾Sadly, The summer is coming to an end. But, I wanted to take the time to recognize my summer student researchers who have been working on pose-estimation this summer: 
  Michael Ortega, Jameson Pham, Parul Methi, and Harini Mudradi. 
  I am headed into my second year serving as a research mentor and I truly cannot tell you how much I have grown through this experience. 
  Working on a interdisciplinary team, provides you with so many new perspectives you wouldnâ€™t otherwise be able to interact with. 
  I canâ€™t wait to see what we will accomplish in together this year. As always feel free to reach out if you have questions on my mentorship experience. ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾
