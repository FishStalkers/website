A Big Thank you to Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) hosting this event! We had the opportunity to talk with young female scientists at the high school and undergraduate level and share our experience with them. I am so excited that these student have the opportunity to engage with this material at such a young age and they are an inspiration to me in their love of mathematics and computer science. I would highly recommend looking into CEISMC to any young person passionate about STEM. As always feel free to comment or message with any questions on my experience! And to all the young female scientists out there: I’M ROUTING FOR YOU!! Happy Girls in Engineering Day!🔬🥼📈
