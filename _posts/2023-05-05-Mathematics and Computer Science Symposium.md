<p>We could not have asked for a better end to the spring semester at the Mathematics and Computer Science Symposium sponsored by Lisa Simonyi, and the women and mathematics program at the Institute for Advanced Study. We were glad to see a strong turn-out from Graduate students form diverse fields interested in how they can incorporate machine learning into their research. Christin Salley, MSE, Arushi Aggarwal, and our honorary teaching assistants from FishStalkers: ML for Behavior Georgia Tech VIP Program did amazing work in facilitating the conference and supporting the learning of our Machine-Teachers We received very great feedback on our teaching techniques and are excited to incorporate your thoughts into our next educational adventures! A very special thanks to Lisa Redding and King Jordan for your invaluable assistance and words of support! 😁 😁
🔥 if you are sad you missed our event, don't worry! This isn't the last you have heard from us! 🔥</p>
