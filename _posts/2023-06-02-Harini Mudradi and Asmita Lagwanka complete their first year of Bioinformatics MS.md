 Congratulations to my Biology undergraduate researcher for their phenomenal work presenting at the Undergraduate Research Symposium! Annelie Minor , Emma Volkmann, and William Hancock came together over the course of a semester to present their work on cross-species cichlid behavioral studies. Annelie Minor and William Hancock have been working with me since September 2022. I have really seen them grow as researchers over this time. In January, Emma join our team as a Fast-Track Scholar and she was diligent in her studies to learn the previous work in this project. As Scientist, I feel it really doesn't matter what we do unless you can convey to others the impacts of our work. I am extremely proud of their efforts to share their research with the broader Georgia Tech Research community!
I could not be happier with the work that they put in to this project and look forward to continuing our work this fall!
