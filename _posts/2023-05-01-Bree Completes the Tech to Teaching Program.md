     As of Today, I have complete my Tech to Teaching Program and my minor in higher education! I have complete my first semester as instructor of record for my awesomely named course, FishStalkers: ML for Behavior and as Head Ta for Bioscience labs. Over the course of a year and a half I have created a course portfolio, establish my teaching philosophy, learned about research proven teaching strategies, and wrote my teaching statement. Through this program, I have developed strong ideas of what actions inspire students and what classrooms help them succeed. I have been challenge to examine those ideas. I have a good foundation to create the educational programs I want to see available to students. Over the summer, I am thinking of starting a blog to document my journey as from instructor to thesis-wizard and as a home for all my thoughts and opinions that have no where to go (so many). So, I will leave you with this first opinion: Fool-proof method of how well you are communicating with your students is how much you learn from them. Any thoughts?
