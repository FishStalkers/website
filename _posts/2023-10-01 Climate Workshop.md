 My mentees Michael Ortega and Jameson Pham presented at the GT & Spelman Climate Workshop conference today and I couldn't be prouder of their dedication as student researchers. Climate science is a critical topic, and it's incredibly impactful to see my mentee find meaningful connections to it through our work and share their finding with our broader research community. I'm grateful to be a part of your journey and Iâ€™m looking forward to continuing great research with you!
