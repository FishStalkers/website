 I had an exciting time representing the McGrath lab at the Bioinformatics orientation poster session! I would love extend a welcome to our new PhD and master students joining the Bioinformatics program. Looking forward to witnessing all the amazing accomplishments you'll achieve! 
  Please feel free to reach out with any questions on our programs or the Georgia tech community! 😁😁🎉
