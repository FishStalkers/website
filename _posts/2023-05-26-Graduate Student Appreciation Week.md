<p>This semester I was celebrated with a display for Graduate Student appreciation week by nomination from my fantastic students researcher in my FishStalkers Georgia Tech VIP Program course. I was asked to chose a item which represent my collaboration, so my students help we made a colleague of our growth and experiences as mentorship group. I have been (and still on) a long journey to mentor my students well and to help them achieve personal success. I am appreciative of them putting their faith in me as their mentor and sticking with our group while I am learning to be an instructor, mentor, and advocate.
🐟 To all my FishStalkers out there, I hope you will consider this a symbol of all of our successes and hard-work this semester, and further I thank you for your nomination. Know that I consider leadership a responsibility and not a privilege of my expertise, and I will continue to do my best to uphold and surpass your expectations for my role. 🐟
If you are interested in my mentorship system feel free to reach out! I am alway happy to help others learn from my experiences (and mistakes haha) 😂</p>
