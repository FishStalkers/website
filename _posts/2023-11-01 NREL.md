I am honored to meet with NRELâ€™s building energy research team as a part of their iniative to recruit a diverse research talent. I learned so much about the impact that building science has on our sustainability goals as a country and the challenges that need motivated researchers to solve. I was excited to see that the people managing building energy projects were encouraging of collaboration in interdisciplinary project and had some interesting ongoing applications to computer vision. I was particularly inspired by the work of Dr. Ardelia Clarke in using data science to critically examine what equity looks like in terms of building performance standards and policy. I am extremely greatful to the building science research team for inviting to here about their cutting-edge research projects! As always, Please feel to reach out to me by comment or direct message if you have any further questions on my experience at NREL.ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰
