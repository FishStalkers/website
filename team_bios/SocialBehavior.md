<h3>Team Leader: Annelie Minor</h3>
<p><strong>About The Team Leade:</strong> I’m a third year biology major from Newtown CT. The main extracurricular I am a part of is the Georgia Tech marching band, where I play cymbals. I’m also part of Kappa Kappa Psi, a band fraternity, and lifeguard at the CRC. A cool fact about me is I have an identical twin.</p>
