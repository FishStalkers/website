<h1> Math and CS Education</h1>
<p><strong>About the Team:</strong> The CS, Math, and Education Team aims to focus on the education aspect of the research by creating by promoting and preparing educational materials teaching Math and CS to host conferences. At the end of the semester, we plan to have a conference on campus for graduate students to promote the education of Math and CS. We are currently preparing teaching content such as tutorials with datasets for linear algebra to numpy and pandas. Throughout our semester of research, we will be conducting research retention in order to focus on the most effective teaching strategies for all the sub groups through surveys and insights. This undertaking has allowed us to best understand the most optimal structure for the conference and understanding education in general to improve the performance and learning of the participants.</p>

<p><strong>About The Team Leader:</strong>  I'm a first year CS student at Tech and I'm really excited to lead a team that aims to promote the research and develop content for promoting education in STEM. I love trying out new things from learning electrical systems as part of Solar Racing to Ballroom Dancing in my free time. I also love all types of outdoor activities, hiking, or the time I went sky diving!</p>
