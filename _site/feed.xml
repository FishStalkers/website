&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to my Biology undergraduate researcher for their phenomenal work presenting at the Undergraduate Research Symposium! Annelie Minor , Emma Volkmann, and William Hancock came together over the course of a semester to present their work on cross-species cichlid behavioral studies. Annelie Minor and William Hancock have been working with me since September 2022. I have really seen them grow as researchers over this time. In January, Emma join our team as a Fast-Track Scholar and she was diligent in her studies to learn the previous work in this project. As Scientist, I feel it really doesn&apos;t matter what we do unless you can convey to others the impacts of our work. I am extremely proud of their efforts to share their research with the broader Georgia Tech Research community!

&lt;p&gt;This semester I was celebrated with a display for Graduate Student appreciation week by nomination from my fantastic students researcher in my FishStalkers Georgia Tech VIP Program course. I was asked to chose a item which represent my collaboration, so my students help we made a colleague of our growth and experiences as mentorship group. I have been (and still on) a long journey to mentor my students well and to help them achieve personal success. I am appreciative of them putting their faith in me as their mentor and sticking with our group while I am learning to be an instructor, mentor, and advocate.
üêü To all my FishStalkers out there, I hope you will consider this a symbol of all of our successes and hard-work this semester, and further I thank you for your nomination. Know that I consider leadership a responsibility and not a privilege of my expertise, and I will continue to do my best to uphold and surpass your expectations for my role. üêü
If you are interested in my mentorship system feel free to reach out! I am alway happy to help others learn from my experiences (and mistakes haha) üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This semester I was celebrated with a display for Graduate Student appreciation week by nomination from my fantastic students researcher in my FishStalkers Georgia Tech VIP Program course.

&lt;p&gt;As of Today, I have complete my Tech to Teaching Program and my minor in higher education! I have complete my first semester as instructor of record for my awesomely named course, FishStalkers: ML for Behavior and as Head Ta for Bioscience labs. Over the course of a year and a half I have created a course portfolio, establish my teaching philosophy, learned about research proven teaching strategies, and wrote my teaching statement. Through this program, I have developed strong ideas of what actions inspire students and what classrooms help them succeed. I have been challenge to examine those ideas. I have a good foundation to create the educational programs I want to see available to students. Over the summer, I am thinking of starting a blog to document my journey as from instructor to thesis-wizard and as a home for all my thoughts and opinions that have no where to go (so many). So, I will leave you with this first opinion: Fool-proof method of how well you are communicating with your students is how much you learn from them. Any thoughts?

We were glad to see a strong turn-out from Graduate students form diverse fields interested in how they can incorporate machine learning into their research. Christin Salley, MSE, Arushi Aggarwal, and our honorary teaching assistants from FishStalkers: ML for Behavior Georgia Tech VIP Program did amazing work in facilitating the conference and supporting the learning of our Machine-Teachers We received very great feedback on our teaching techniques and are excited to incorporate your thoughts into our next educational adventures!

&lt;p&gt;The First Generation of FishStalkers is here!! 39 students interested in the fields of Biology, Computer Science, or Math then have come together to design novel approaches for studying complex behavior using computational tools. In this project student work collaboratively with a inter-disiplinary team of both graduate and undergraduate researchers. We are proud to announce the creation of 4 team projects: Computer Vision, Gene expression, Social Behavior, Math , CS, and education. To learn more, check out the Teams tab.&lt;/p&gt;
