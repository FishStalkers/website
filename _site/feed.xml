&lt;p&gt;The First Generation of FishStalkers is here!! 39 students interested in the fields of Biology, Computer Science, or Math then have come together to design novel approaches for studying complex behavior using computational tools. In this project student work collaboratively with a inter-disiplinary team of both graduate and undergraduate researchers. We are proud to announce the creation of 4 team projects: Computer Vision, Gene expression, Social Behavior, Math , CS, and education. To learn more, check out the Teams tab.&lt;/p&gt;
