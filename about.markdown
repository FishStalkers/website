FishStalkers use machine learning to robustly understand the connection between observed behavior and brain function. Students will be working in groups arranged according to field. Each project will have a biological, mathematical, and computational component. Student will rely on the work and expertise of other in their group to communicate how the biology, math, and computer science should be considered with respect to their problem.
